You need to build a web application with Flutter and your demo should have at least features in [Must have](#must-have), things in [Nice to have](#nice-to-have) is optional (but yeah, it's attractive if you have).

### Must have:

- Search for a city or country and display weather information:
  - Show the weather includes temperature, wind speed, humidity... for present day.
  - Show forecast 4 days later and more (load more).
- Save temporary weather information history and allow display again during the day.
- There is a function to register and unsubscribe to receive daily weather forecast information via email address. Email confirmation is ***`required`***.
- Deploy the Flutter Web App to go live. (Recommend to use Firebase Hosting)

### Nice to have:

- Responsive design (look good on all devices: desktops, tablets & mobile phones).
- Smooth animations (just do what you think is good).

# Technical Requirements
- Language: Flutter / Kotlin / Swift or React Native
- Fonts (optional):
