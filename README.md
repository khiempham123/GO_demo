  - Show forecast 4 days later and more (load more).
- Save temporary weather information history and allow display again during the day.
- There is a function to register and unsubscribe to receive daily weather forecast information via email address. Email confirmation is ***`required`***.
- Deploy the application to go live.

### Nice to have:

- Responsive design (look good on all devices: desktops, tablets & mobile phones).
- Smooth animations (just do what you think is good).
- Setup project use Docker.
